# Evolve
This project attempts to use genetic algorithms to evolve optimal solutions to difficult problems. The main focus of this project is (1) genetic curve fitting and (2) genetic programming.

## Genetic Curve Fitting
Genetic curve fitting attempts to evolve optimal functions that actually map a set of inputs (x) to a set of outputs (y). The goal of this project is to develop the shortest, but most accurate curve that maps a set of data points. This curve can then be used a lossily compressed version of the data that it encodes.

## Genetic Programming
Genetic programming (GP) attempts to evolve optimal programs that solve a specified problem. The focus of my implementation is on deterministic, comparison sorting algorithms (e.g., insertion sort, bubble sort, etc.), but I have designed the code to eventually work with arbitrary problems and arbitrary instruction sets.
